# SkyClimb
SkyClimb brings a true climbing mechanic to Skyrim. Utilizing EVG Traversal's animations, SkyClimb uses techniques seen in modern games to allow you to realistically climb onto anything.

All praise the Lord "Sokco" for this amazing mod.

The DLL under "build-161170/Release" is a temporary fix for the 161170 version of Skyrim SE.
